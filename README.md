## ComfyUI Dynamic Flow Control

Supports node caching, dynamic branch blocking/switching, smarter node output reuse.

Note: No longer compatible with latest version of ComfyUI.

### How to use

Download and replace the execution.py file in the main ComfyUI folder.

Needs custom nodes from [comfyui-sv-nodes](https://github.com/SirVeggie/comfyui-sv-nodes) to do anything interesting.
